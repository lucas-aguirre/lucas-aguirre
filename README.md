### ðŸ‘‹&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello!

I am a backend developer with 5 years of experience in the field. Currently, I work using technologies such as PHP/NodeJS, MongoDB, GraphQL and PostgreeSQL, as well as AWS services. Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on challenging projects, including the restructuring of a client integration platform and the creation of a mobile application.

My key skills include system development using NodeJS, Typescript, React, and databases such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB. I also have experience in utilizing AWS services such as CloudFormation, Lambda, SNS, SQS, and ECS for infrastructure creation and configuration.

Additionally, I have a strong academic background in Analysis and Systems Development and have been recognized for winning a hackathon in college with an application aimed at combating childhood obesity.

I am always seeking challenges and opportunities to enhance my skills and contribute to project success. I am a dedicated, organized professional capable of working in teams, adopting agile methodologies such as Scrum.
